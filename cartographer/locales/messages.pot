"    This cog can backup & restore the following:\n"
"    - Categories (permissions/order)\n"
"    - Text channels (permissions/order)\n"
"    - Voice channels (permissions/order)\n"
"    - Forum channels  (permissions/order)[Not forum posts]\n"
"    - Roles (permissions and what members they're assigned to)\n"
"\n"
"    **Caveats**\n"
"    Note the following\n"
"    - If there are multiple roles, channels, categories, or forums with the same name, only 1 of each will be restored.\n"
"     - This is because object IDs cannot be restored so the bot relies on the name of the object.\n"
"    - When restoring, some roles may not be fully restored (such as order) if they were higher than the bot's role.\n"
